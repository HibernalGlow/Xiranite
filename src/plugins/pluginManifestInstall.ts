/**
 * Turns a `manifest.toml` into a host install record — the step §2.1 promised and §9 kept listing as
 * missing ("记录今天来自 query 而不是清单文件").
 *
 * Two boundaries to keep straight:
 * - the **vocabulary** belongs to `@xiranite/contract` (`parseFrontendPluginManifest`), because the
 *   manifest is Xiranite's contract file and the CLI must read the same spelling the app does;
 * - the **policy** stays here: which capabilities a plugin is granted is not in the manifest at all
 *   (§2.1's `[permissions]` is backend-facing, and the frontend ceiling is the host's), and the host's
 *   own frontend API version is what `required_api` is checked against. A reader that let a manifest
 *   hand itself grants or trust would recreate the privilege hole closed in §6.
 *
 * `[frontend] alias` goes to the record's `alias` and therefore to `RemoteInfo.name` — the word
 * `loadRemote` is keyed by — and **not** to `moduleId`, which stays the plugin id. That split is what
 * the live probe forced: the example builds its container as `poc_frontend` (alias) while its plugin id
 * is `poc-frontend`, and conflating the two produced `Module "poc_frontend" failed to load`. A plugin
 * that *replaces* a built-in module still says so, just through the record's `moduleId` (the dev page's
 * `&module=`), not through the manifest's alias.
