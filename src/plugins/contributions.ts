/**
 * Runtime contributions a frontend plugin adds to the host — the `[[contributions]]` half of
 * `docs/plugin-architecture.md` §2.1, restricted to the kinds that actually have a consumer.
 *
 * §10.1 第 1 条 is the rule this obeys: only `component`, `tray` and `window` may be opened, and a
 * new kind must not be accepted before something reads it (that is how `allowed_paths` became a
 * documented-but-dead field on the old backend). Today only `component` is implemented here; tray and
 * window contributions exist for built-in nodes (`trayCoordinator`, `nodeWindowPreferences`) and will
 * join this map when a plugin path for them is wired.
 *
 * Why the metadata has to come from the install record rather than the remote: the module library
 * lists modules *before* loading them (§2.2's 「不 load 组件也能拿到 NodeDef」). A plugin's `def` lives
 * inside its bundle, so listing it would mean fetching and evaluating every installed plugin at
 * startup — which is exactly the eager behaviour this document refuses to copy from Backstage.
