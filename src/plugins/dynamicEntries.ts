 * The one place that answers "where does this module's entry come from".

 * single lookup is the whole integration surface for frontend plugins — the shape of a
 * `NodeEntry`/`AppNodeEntry` (`packages/contract`) is untouched, only its provenance became
 * pluggable (`docs/plugin-architecture.md` §2.3).
 *
 * Two sources, one contract:
 *   - static: the generated table, which Vite can still split per node;
 *   - dynamic: a Module Federation remote built outside this repository, loaded on first use.
