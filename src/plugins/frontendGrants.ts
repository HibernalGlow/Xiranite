/**
 * The 授权 layer of `docs/plugin-architecture.md` §10.1 第 3 条, as an artifact that can be pointed at.
 *
 * Before this module the three layers were really two: `FrontendPluginSpec.capabilities` was the
 * plugin's declaration *and* the thing the projection honoured, so anything inside
 * {@link GRANTABLE_FRONTEND_CAPABILITIES} was granted by the act of being declared. §795 names the
 * missing piece as 「谁批准」 — there was no decision to attribute, revoke, or show.
 *
 * What this is not: it is not the consent UI. There is still no dialog, so today the only caller is the
 * dev install page, at the same moment it declares pins and origins — the place a human is already
 * saying yes. The UI is a later button writing into this store, not a new mechanism. Per that,
 * nothing here pretends to know *who* approved; a field claiming an approver that no dialog produced
 * would be a fake audit trail.
 *
 * Revocation is the reason this is worth a store at all: `revokeFrontendPluginApproval` takes
 * namespaces away from an installed plugin without uninstalling it, which the spec field could never
 * express (rewriting the declaration looked like the plugin had never asked).
 *
 * Storage sits beside the install records (same `localStorage` rationale as §2.5: the host-side write
 * route is still missing). Approval is **not** re-derivable from a record — records carry what was
 * declared, and a declaration must not silently re-grant itself on the next start.
